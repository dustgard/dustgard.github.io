            <p>Oakley’s website I think has a very good setup and modern look to it. It uses a scrolling technique which looks good, plus it makes the page load time very fast. Very sleek and simple logo at the top of the screen. The site is scalable and looks great on a mobile device. I like the simple picture at the very top of the page with the shop now button. The only thing I did not like was when you scrolled over the tabs at the top of the screen, that they did not automatically drop-down for view. You must click on each tab and then it changes the main photo to whatever item you pick. I think an automatic drop-down that was simple would be easier to navigate with. What I think makes this website stand out from others I have seen is the rollover function on the photos of glasses. When you hover your mouse over the pictures the picture changes to a different view of the sunglasses. Oakley’s website is using HTML5 and the source code is very well organized and looks to be using tables within div classes. This website is very easy to navigate around, and you can find exactly what you are looking for. The white background makes the picture of the sunglasses and the lens's colors pop. I believe the creators wanted something streamline and is easy to use to browse and purchase their products. This site has amazing pictures of their products and makes me want to own multiple pairs.</p>
