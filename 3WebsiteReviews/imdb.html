            <p>I like IMDBâ€™s website because it looks modern and is very easy to navigate to what you are looking for. You can spend hours looking up movies or actors and fall into a black hole of time. The website for IMDB has very appealing colors and although it has a lot of content on the main page, it still provides a great way to locate the information that you desire. The website stands out from other websites because it has a variety of different options for how you choose to search for items and contains, as far as I know, every movie ever made. The source code for the page was confusing to me. The code starts with the !DOCTYPE html but is incredibly difficult to follow what was going on within the structure. The code does you HTML5 elements but no tables. The website is scalable and looks good on mobile devices as well. This website overall is very enjoyable to use and can entertain users for hours. One of the big standouts for the website was the section to browse other streaming services and see what was playing. I think that the creators want to make an extensive movie and tv website but have the simplicity of something easy to navigate but also the availability to get into the weeds if you want. The dark mode colors add to the movie and tv shows artwork.
