            <p>The serene-naturist website is one of the worst websites I have ever visited. Right from the beginning if you click on the Naturist link the website starts to play music of birds chirping in the background and flapping their wings. The music plays for about a minute and then does not repeat, which I was happy not to hear again. The website has multiple GIF’s going on at one time, this is very distracting to the eyes and is borderline offensive. The pictures on the website are in random spots and sizes and do not seem to flow very well. The page is not resizable and looks terrible on a mobile device. Some of the links do not work on the Index page. On the website's shaving section they have a picture of a baby shaving and I could not stop laughing. This website looks very outdated and does not flow well at all but the code itself looks well organized. Serene naturist did use HTML5 elements and seemed to use tables. The site's multiple uses of colors and fonts were also very distracting. The home page also had a disclaimer stating, “Please all a few moments for images to load before scrolling down the page.” This shows that the designer knew that this was happening and instead of fixing it decided to just tell people to hold on a minute. This website was also causing me to download something even though I was not asked.</p>
