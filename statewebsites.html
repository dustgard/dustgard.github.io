    <h1>1. <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/#gsc.tab=0">Vermont</a></h1>
    <p>This website is my top favorite because the modern style of the layout. It looked simple but has everything you need to navigate throughout the website. I really like the seamless pictures and it was very easy to know what you were looking at. I also liked the hover over design of the buttons and that you could click anywhere on the picture, taking you to the new page. Although all the other pages besides the homepage looked boring, the website grabs you right away with the first one shown. The pictures used on the homepage are amazing and really fit each section nicely. This website by far seemed the most modern to me except for the other pages. It looks like they have just not updated them yet and seems to break away from the homepage design.

    <h1>2. <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a></h1>
    <p>Iowa’s site right off the bat took a little while to load the header, which I did not like. The website seems very busy with text flashing across the screen. The overall design of the site looks more on the modern side and auto adjusts to the change in screen size. I really like how easy it is to find what you are looking for on this site. I also liked the background image stayed the same on some parts while you scrolled down the page. I like the color scheme that Iowa’s website uses and beside the flashing words at the top of the page, it is eye pleasing. The website seemed simple but still functional.</p>

    <h1>3. <a href="https://oklahoma.gov/">Oklahoma</a></h1>
    <p>I really like the look and design of this website because it is easy to follow and has a very modern look to it. The only drawback to the website at first glance is that the photos on the top of the page change rather quick when your mouse is not on the window. This feature annoyed me when I was typing my review. The website did auto adjust to screen size changes. The structure and the way items are separated was fantastic. This made navigating the site easy and enjoyable. The website was not cluttered and flowed seamlessly. </p>

    <h1>4. <a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a></h1>
    <p>The picture changes quickly when the mouse is not in the window of the website annoys me and makes me feel rushed. The overall beginning page colors seem very boring and I believe could have made the header image standout a little more. I did not like the social media section and feel that it takes up too much room on the page by being in block format. I think that the footer looked better than the header because of the colors and simplicity. The main section of the webpage was well designed, and I like the buttons incorporate pictures along with text. It was very easy to find what you are looking for on this website.</p>

    <h1>5. <a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h1>
    <p>This is my least favorite website because it was so cluttered and messy. I was immediately taken back from all the information shoved in front of my eyes. I do not like how cluttered it is and at a first glance is overwhelming to take it all in. There are multiple menus on top of other menus. Some of the pictures used on the website look blurry to me, for example the logo. If you change the screen size it does not auto adjust making the mobile application very small and hard to read. This site overall colors I think go well with the overall theme and every item is visible. The website loaded very fast and the source code look organized. </p>
